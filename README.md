# Hello Work technical test
## Description
This is a pnpm workspace containing two projects:

**Frontend**: A Next.js application that displays job listings in Bordeaux with search functionality and pagination.

**API**: A backend API that provides job listings data to the frontend.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the projects, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
pnpm (version 6 or higher)

## Installation
Install the dependencies at the root of the workspace:

```
pnpm install
```

## Environment Variables:

Configure the environment variables for both the frontend and API projects as per their respective README.md files.

For example, in the frontend, create a .env.local file with the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```
Important: Follow the setup recommendations from both the frontend and API projects before launching the applications.

## Running the Projects
This workspace is configured to run the frontend and API projects individually or in parallel.

### Running Frontend Only
To run the Next.js frontend application:
    
```
pnpm start:front
```
### Running API Only
To run the API project:
```
pnpm start:api
```

### Running Both Frontend and API in Parallel
To run both projects concurrently:

```
pnpm start:all
```
This will start the frontend and the API simultaneously.

Useful Workspace Scripts
Here are some useful scripts that can be run from the root of the workspace:

pnpm run start:frontend: Starts the frontend project.
pnpm run start:api: Starts the API project.
pnpm run start:all: Runs both the frontend and API in parallel.
pnpm install: Installs dependencies for both projects.
Deployment
Each project (frontend and API) can be deployed separately. Follow the deployment instructions in each projectâ€™s README.md file.

The frontend can be deployed to Vercel or any other Next.js-compatible hosting service.
The API can be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS, Heroku, or any Node.js hosting provider.
